Marking scheme

Student ID:  s1687568

Total Mark: 82/100

A very good report.

Part 1, Learning Rate Schedules (10 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -implement one time-dependent schedule [5/5]
 -comparison of time-dependent vs constant learning rate [2/2]
 -explore hyperparameters [3/3]
 
Very good.

Part 2, Momentum Learning Rule (15 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -implement momentum with hyperparameter [5/5]
 -compare vanilla GD vs GD+momentum for different momentum hyperparam values [2/3]
 -explore how momentum hyperparam influences training in terms of learning curve and final accuracy (training + validation sets) [4/4]
 -investigate momentum rate schedules [1/3]

It would be good to be more explicit in comparing vanilla GD vs GD+momentum, and to run more experiments with the hyperparameters of the momentum rate schedule.

Part 3, Adaptive Learning Rules (40 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -Implement two adaptive learning rules [20/20: 12 for the first, 8 for the second]
 -compare each adaptive learning rate vs GD+momentum vs vanilla-GD [7/10]
 -explore hyperparameter varition for each adaptive LR approach [8/10]

This is good, but could again be a little bit more specific in comparing to previous techniques in terms of both final measures and training evolution, and try some more settings of the hyperparameters.

Presentation and clarity of report (25 marks).
Marks awarded for overall structure, clear and concise presentation, providing enough information to enable work to be reproduced, clear and concise presentation of results, informative discussion and conclusions.
Check list
 - overall structure, organisation, and writing style [5/7]
 - clear description of experiments, reproducibility [6/7]
 - presentation of results [6/7]
 - discussion and conclusion [3/4]

Explain all notation when including equations. The structure could be improved, with clearly delineating introductions,
experiment methodologies, results and corresponding discussion.
Multiple settings of hyperparameters can be plotted on the same graph or tabled in the same table,
affording easier comparisons between hyperparameter settings, and also cutting down on the length of the paper.
Think more in terms of a research paper. Also it would be good to motivate the reasons for setting various hyperparameters.

Additional Excellence (10 marks). 
Marks awarded for significant personal insight, creativity, originality, and/or extra depth and academic maturity.

Good to see plots of learning rate and coefficient evolutions [5]
