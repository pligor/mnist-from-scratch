curriculum_learning, models, mylibs and rnn are all python modules. Note that these were implemented using Pycharm IDE.
The specific origin of classes or functions being used from these modules are being explained explicitly inside the report.
For example it is specified explicitly that ManualRNN originates from rnn.manual_rnn module.
As the python convention is, this class is found inside rnn folder and file manual_rnn.py.

notebooks folder contains all the jupyter python notebooks

report_parts contains the report split in different files for easier exploration. Parts are in both odt and pdf format.

Full merged PDF report is found at root folder (as this text file)

Enjoy!
